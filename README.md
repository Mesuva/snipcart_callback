# snipcart_callback
An example of how to use the on_snipcart_callback event triggered by the [Snipcart package for concrete5](http://www.concrete5.org/marketplace/addons/ecommerce-with-snipcart) when new orders are received via the webhook UR.

The package when installed, simply logs the order data the event receives to concrete5's log.

Instead of logging the data, this data could be used to perform a custom action.
